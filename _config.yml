# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  A brutally honest blog for the neuro-spicy, fiercely ambitious, and proudly
  inconsistent. Built by Nathan Perry and far too much caffeine, this isn’t a
  “how-to-hustle” guide—it’s a real account of building, breaking, and
  occasionally thriving in a world built for someone else’s definition of
  functional. Sometimes genius, sometimes a mess, always authentic.

# IMPORTANT: You must change these two settings for your site to work.
# The baseurl is the name of your repository.
# The url is your GitHub username's domain.
baseurl: "/inconsistentlyfunctional"
