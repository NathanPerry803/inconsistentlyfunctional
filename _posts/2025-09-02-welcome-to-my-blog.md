## Welcome to my blog!
This is my first post on my new, self-hosted blog. It's powered by Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

You can edit this file to create your own content using **Markdown**, which is a simple way to format text.

### Some examples:
* Headings with `#` or `##`
* **Bold text** with double asterisks
* `Code blocks` with backticks
